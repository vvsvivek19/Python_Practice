the bat in the hat

the bat in the hat, the bat in the hat,
so sly and so sly, a mischievous bat!
he came with a box, the bat in the hat,
a tall, red and white striped, mischievous bat!

the bat in the hat
the bat in the hat, the bat in the hat,
played games in the rain, the bat in the hat,
and made a big mess, the bat in the hat,
a sloppy, wet mess, the bat in the hat!

the bat in the hat
the bat in the hat, the bat in the hat,
said, "clean up, clean up, everybody clean up!"
but the mess was so big, the bat in the hat,
he needed some help, the bat in the hat!
